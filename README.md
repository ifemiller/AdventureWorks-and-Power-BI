An end to end Data Analysis project guided by this [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7o5Wju-PZg&t=0s)


MS SQL Server has an open-source database called AdventureWorks that can be used to run queries. By cleaning the data with some simple SQL queries, I was able to export the resulting tables as csv's and load them into Power BI.
